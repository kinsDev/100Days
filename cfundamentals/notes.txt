Types
Variables are used to store data temporarily during program execution.
Every Variable must have a type. A type specifies the type of data a variable will hold.

Declarations
variables must be declared. e.g: int height - state that height is a variable of type of int.
We can have several variables of the same type e.g int height, age, date, price;

Assignment
A variable can be given a value by means of assignment. e.g height = 22;
N/B - A varibale needs to be declared before it can be assigned a value
int height;
height = 22;

Its important to append a letter "f" to a float value e.g 22.456f, otherwise we might get an error.
