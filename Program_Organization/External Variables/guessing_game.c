/*
To get more experience with external variables, we'll write a simple game-playing
program. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. which the
user attempts to guess in as few tries as possible. 

Hereâ€™s what the user will see when the program is run:

Guess the secret number between 1 and 100.

A new number has been chosen.

Enter guess: 55
Too low; try again.
Enter guess: 65
Too high; try again.
Enter guess: 60
Too high; try again.
Enter guess: 58
You won in 4 guesses!
Play again? (Y/N) y
A new number has been chosen.
Enter guess: 18.
Too high; try again.
Enter guess: 34
You won in 2 guesses!
Play again? (Y/N) n

/*
To generate random numbers in C, you can use the rand() function from the <stdlib.h> library. 
However, the rand() function alone will generate the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers each time you run the program, as it is initialized with a fixed seed value. 
To get different random numbers each time, you can use the srand() function to seed the random number generator with a changing value, such as the current time.
