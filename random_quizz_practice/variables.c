/**
 * C is a statically typed language. This means that it variables have an associated type and are ran at compile time.
 * When you create a variable in C you have to specify the type of of varable in declaration.
 * For example if its integer you can specify it like this int 22.
 * variables can contain any uppercase or lowercase, can have an underscore, and can contain digits.
 * But cannot start with a digit. e.g int 1age.

 * char - stores letters and in some cases integers from -128 to 127. Takes atleast 1byte
 * int - takes atleast 2bytes.
 * short - 2bytes.

 * float - representing numbers to decimal points times powers of 10. Both +ve & -ve numbers. 10^-37 to 10^+37. 32bits
 * double - Does what float does with a bigger set of numbers.
 * long double - Does what float and double does but with a bigger set of numbers.

 * unsigned char - 0 to 255.
