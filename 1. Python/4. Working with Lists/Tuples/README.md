Tuples allow you to create a list of items that you cannot change.
Python values that canoot be changes are called immutables.
And a python list that cannot be changed is called a tuple.

A tuple looks like lists, but instead you use parenthesis instead of square brackets.
```
dimensions = (200, 50)
```
