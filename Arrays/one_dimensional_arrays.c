/**
An array is a data structure containing a number of data values, all of which have
the same type. These values, known as elements, can be individually selected by
their position within the array.

To declare an array, we must specify the type of the array’s elements and the
number of elements. For example, to declare that the array a has 10 elements of
type int. we would write
int a[10];

using a macro to define the length of an array is an excellent practice:
#define N 10
•••
int a [N] ;
