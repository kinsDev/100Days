/**
 * Parameters
appear in function definitions; theyâ€™re dummy names that represent values to be
supplied when the function is called.

Arguments are expressions that appear in
function calls.

In C. arguments are passed by value: when a function is called, each argument
is evaluated and its value assigned to the corresponding parameter.
