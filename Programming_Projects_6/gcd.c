/**
Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then calculates and displays their
greatest common divisor (GCD):

Enter two integers: 12 28
Greatest common divisor: 4

Hint: The classic algorithm for computing the GCD. known as Euclidâ€™s algorithm, goes as
follows:

Let m and n be variables containing the two numbers. 
If n is 0, then stop: m contains the GCD. 
Otherwise, compute the remainder when m is divided by n. 
Copy n into m and copy the remainder into n. Then repeat the process, starting with testing whether n is 0.
