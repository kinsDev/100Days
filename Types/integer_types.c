/**
Values of an integer type are whole numbers.
The integer types, in turn, are divided into two categories: signed and unsigned.

the following six combinations actually produce different types:
short int
unsigned short int - NB: order doesn't matter - e.g: short unsigned int
int
unsigned int
long int
unsigned long int

long signed int - long int

NB: integers are always signed unless otherwise specified.
    int doesn't have to be included,it can be omitted.
