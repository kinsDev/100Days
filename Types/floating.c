/**
The integer types aren’t suitable for all applications. Sometimes we’ll need vari¬
ables that can store numbers with digits after the decimal point, or numbers that are
exceedingly large or small. Numbers like these tire stored in floating-point format

float           Single-precision floating-point
double          Double-precision floating-point
long double     Extended-precision floating-point

float is suitable when the amount of precision isn't critical (e.g calculating tempera¬
tures to one decimal point), double provides greater precision—
enough for most programs, long double, which supplies the ultimate in preci¬
sion. is rarely used.
