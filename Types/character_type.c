/**
char ...;

A variable of type char can be assigned any single character:
char Ch;
ch = 'a';     lower-case a
ch = 'A';     upper-case A
ch = '0â€™;     zero
ch = ' ';     space

NB: Notice that character constants are enclosed in single quotes, not double quote
    C treats characters as small integers.

C allows the use of the words signed and unsigned to modify char:
signed char sch;
unsigned char uch;
