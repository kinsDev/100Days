/**
The integer types and floating types are collectively known as arithmetic types.

arithmetic types in C89, divided into categories and sub¬categories:
* Integral types
• char
• Signed integer types (signed char, short int, int, long int)
• Unsigned integer types (unsigned char, unsigned short int,
unsigned int. unsigned long int)
• Enumerated types
* Floating types (float, double, long double)


C99 has a more complicated hierarchy for its arithmetic types:
* Integer types
• char
• Signed integer types, both standard (signed char, short int, int,
long int. long long int) and extended
• Unsigned integer types, both standard (unsigned char, unsigned
short int, unsigned int, unsigned long int, unsigned
long long int, _Bool) and extended
• Enumerated types
* Floating types
• Real floating types (float, double, long double)
• Complex types (float _Complex, double ^Complex, long dou¬
ble Complex)
